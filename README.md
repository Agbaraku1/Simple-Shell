This project involves the coding of a simple Unix shell from scratch.We created a shell that would utilize the command line interface (CLI). It will allow users to type in a defined set of commands just like the SH or BASH shell and have the operating system run the appropriate function. This shell has been made to handle memory leaks and has basic functionality. You can create/write/read/open/remove folders, print things to the terminal, change directories, print your location in the system amongst other things that a simple shell can do.
